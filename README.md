## Project Description:

It is required to develop a console application that performs different operations
on matrices. The application should support:

● Addition of two matrices.

● Subtraction of two matrices.

● Multiplication of two matrices.

● Division of two matrices.

● Calculation of determinant of a matrix.

The program needs to be interactive, it asks the user first to supply dimensions of
the matrices, then fill values in each. Then the user of the program is asked to
choose the type of operation or choose to quit, then displays the calculated
output based on the user’s choice. The program keeps asking the user for inputs
until the user decides to quit.

## Tool Used

Code::Blocks is a free C/C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its users. It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable.
Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with plugins. Any kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a plugin. For instance, event compiling and debugging functionality is provided by plugins!
